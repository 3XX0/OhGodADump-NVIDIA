||-VBIOS Findings-||

- There seems to be a unique signature bit after each timing or value field, but also a unique signature generated by a license file for each employee. These license files are regularly switched (and old ones deactivated) so there is no way to forge a signature. 

- The DL/DT Table is related to how quickly the current can change, which directly impacts clock gating. 

- The P106-100 Memory Clock Ranges are: 
	0-540
	541-1299
	1300-2800
	2801-3300
	3301-3700
	3701-4500

- The memory clock for each pState is:
	P8: 405
	P5: 810
	P0: 4004

||-On GeForce-||

- For those who claim to be able to 'inject' stuff into the NVIDIA driver - take heed. It's most likely not (easily) possible. This isn't like AMD, where the driver does most of the management for settings; Falcon is there. Watching. Eating mice. And whatever else Falcon's do. 

- A GeForce card cannot be turned into a pure compute card without blowing some fuses.

||-FLashing a NVIDIA Bios-||

1) Turn off protection:
    nvflash64 --protectoff
    For more than one card:
    nvflash64 --protectoff 6 (if you have 7 GPUs, etc.)
2) Backup original BIOS:
    nvflash64 --save filename.rom
3) Flash BIOS:
    nvflash64 -6 biosfilename.rom

If your screen goes black, hit y twice.

Reboot, reinstall driver, reboot again. 

4) To flash multiple cards:
    nvflash64 --list
    nvflash64 -6 --index=0 BIOSfilename.rom
    nvflash64 -6 --index=1 BIOSfilename.rom
