- The DL/DT Table is related to how quickly the current can change, which directly impacts clock gating. 

- The P106-100 Memory Clock Ranges are: 
	0-540
	541-1299
	1300-2800
	2801-3300
	3301-3700
	3701-4500

- The memory clock for each pState is:
	P8: 405
	P5: 810
	P0: 4004

- For those who claim to be able to 'inject' stuff into the NVIDIA driver - take heed. It's most likely not (easily) possible. This isn't like AMD, where the driver does most of the management for settings; Falcon is there. Watching. Eating mice. And whatever else Falcon's do. 

- A GeForce card cannot be turned into a pure compute card without blowing some fuses.
